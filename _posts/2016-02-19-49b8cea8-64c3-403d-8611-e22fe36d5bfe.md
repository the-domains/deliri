You hear this term casually mentioned in movies and TV shows. You often hear people throw analogies around in order to help facilitate understanding. You'll see it compared to recipes, methods, processes, etc. How accurate are these analogies? Let's find out together. An algorithm in the computer science world has a very well defined meaning. 

What you are after is a solution to a problem, and you give the computer a set of rules to follow so that it can arrive at your hoped for solution within a finite number of steps. It has qualities which we can keep in the back of our minds.

1\. Finiteness ::   
This means your algorithm has to terminate within a finite number of steps. An infinite loop is completely useless. Although, if a procedure has all the characteristics of an algorithm except that it doesn't have finiteness, it may be called a computational method. 

2\. Definiteness ::  
Each step the algorithm takes must be precisely defined. There is no room for ambiguity. There has to be a well throughout rigorous standard applied to ensure this is the case. 

3\. Input ::  
An algorithm has zero or more inputs. You feed it some quantities before the algorithm begins. 

4\. Output ::  
It should have at least 1 or more outputs for it to be useful. The whole reason we use algorithms is to get to answers in the first place.

5\. Effectiveness ::   
Imagine you have a large piece of paper, on which there are drawn 1 billion tiny squares. I come along and I pick one particular square and I put a dot on the paper but you can't really see it. You can ask me questions which I can answer only with yes or no. 

Stupid way: You ask me about each individual square and you hope to get lucky. In which case there is no determining how long it will take you to complete the task because you cannot account for how lucky you will be. 

Effective way: You draw a line dividing the paper in exactly half. You ask me if it is in the top half. With my answer, you can immediately eliminate 500 million squares. Follow this process a few times over and even with the worst case scenario it will only take you roughly 30 steps to get to the answer. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/29283c42-1123-4e9a-bcc4-ff7e77231a54.png)

So is an algorithm like a recipe?   
Well, no because recipes are ambiguous. They say things like add a "dash" of salt, or a "pinch" of sugar. As much as analogies are helpful, they can sometimes lead us astray if we are not careful.
